    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, roughly minced</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>5 eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped zucchini </li>
        <li>1 (9 inch/23 cm) unbaked pastry shell </li>
        <li>1 and ½ cups chopped onion </li>
        <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon curry powder </li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese </li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly shredded Cheddar cheese </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of salt over the chopped zucchini and mix well. Let it sit for <strong>10 minutes</strong> to drain water.</li>

        <li><strong>Preheat</strong> oven to <strong>235°C (450°F)</strong>. Line pastry shell with a <strong>double layer thickness</strong> of heavy-duty aluminium foil. </li>

        <li>Bake pastry shell in preheated oven for <strong>5 minutes</strong>. <em>Remove foil</em> and bake for about another <strong>5 minutes longer</strong>, until shell is lightly browned.</li>

        <li>Reduce oven heat to <strong>175°C (350°F)</strong></li>

        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over <strong>medium heat</strong>. Cook and stir onions, green peppers, tomatoes, nushrooms, garlic and zucchini until just tender. Stir in curry powder, ½ teaspoon salt, pepper and cinnamon.
            <ul>
                <li>Spoon vegetable mixture into crust.</li>
            </ul> 
        </li>

        <li>Beat eggs in a bowl; stir in milk, Parmesan cheese, and Cheddar cheese. Carefully pour egg mixture over vegetables.</li>

        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out <em>clean</em> with no uncooked egg on it, this should take roughly <strong>40 to 45 minutes</strong>. Let it <strong><em>rest for 5 minutes</em></strong> before cutting and serving.</li>

    </ol>
