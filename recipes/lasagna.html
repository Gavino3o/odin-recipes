        <li><strong>Drain</strong> the pasta and shock it with <strong>ice water</strong> to prevent it from further cooking.</li>

        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill the saucepan with water to <em>just below</em> the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil and add spinach. Cover the saucepan and steam for 2 to 6 minutes until tender. Drain the spinach</li>

        <li>
            Spread ¼ cup tomato pasta sauce on the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; top with 3 sheets of lasagna noodles, ½ cup of the ricotta mixture, and ¼ cup tomato pasta sauce. Repeat layers of 3 more noodles, ½ cup ricotta mixture, and ¼ cup pasta sauce.
             <ul>
                 <li>End with remaining 3 lasagna noodles and ¼ cup pasta sauce. Sprinkle ½ cup Mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese on top. Fully cover casserole with <strong>aluminum foil</strong>.</li>
                </ul>
         </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for <strong>25 minutes</strong>. <strong>Uncover</strong> the aluminium foil from the casserole and continue baking for roughly another 25 minutes until lasagna is <strong><em>bubbling and golden browned.</em></strong></li>
